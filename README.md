# Overview

My goal in making this program was to learn how to make a database with Google Firebase's Realtime Database feature.
I plan to continue working on this project for a few more weeks, but as for now the frontend contains simple HTML, Javascript, and CSS files to demonstrate that I have built a database in Firebase and can read information from it. The database contains information about the busses that are run by the apartment complex I live in. I hope to be able to work on the frontend more in the next few weeks to be able to have a useful user interface that my fellow residents and I can use to see when and where the busses will be at any given time.

# Cloud Database

I created a database in the cloud using Google Firebase's "Realtime Database" feature.
This database acts almost like a mega dictionary, meaning it is just a few key:value pairs for each bus route.
The structure on a high level is that there is a database with bus routes. Each route has an index (0-256) and each index is connected to several key:value pairs (for "bus_line", "departure_location", "destination_location", "est_departure", and for some "days_running"), which contain values that describe 1 stop of a bus (An example of the type of information it holds: The Green bus is leaving at 11:20 from the Snow building to the Smith building).

# Development Environment

- Google Firebase 10.4.0 - Realtime Database
- Visual Studio Code
- node/npm (to implement the database)
- HTML
- Javascript
- CSS

# Future Work

- Make functions in Javascript to add and delete the right values from a list of all the different bus routes that are shown
- Add different selectors (dropdowns, toggles, etc.) that the user can use to "Query" the database with different stipulations
- CSS (beautify!)
